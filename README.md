# Evolutionary game theory in a cell: A membrane computing approach

Welcome to the repository for the P System developed in the paper [Evolutionary game theory in a cell: A membrane computing approach](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002002552101330X) published in `Information Sciences 589, 2022. pp.: 580-594. DOI: 10.1016/j.ins.2021.12.109`. The model has been implemented using the programming language [P-Lingua](http://www.p-lingua.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). This repository contains the codebase for replicating and exploring the model described in the paper.

If you have any doubts or inquiries about the model or the paper, please don't hesitate to reach me out.
